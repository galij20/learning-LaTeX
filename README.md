# learning-LaTeX
This repository is dedicated to document my journey on learning LaTeX, the typesetting tool used usually used in STEM.

I will be learning the following: 
- Installing LaTeX and plugging it with vim or nvim,
- Learning the standard document structure,
- Packages and implementing them,
- Text formatting,
- Bibliography,
- Mathatical Expressions and Equations and such.

I'll be ending this journey by preparing the case studies on Instrumentation and Operating Systems in LaTeX.


# Setup

I will be setting up LaTeX on my local machine using [TeX Live](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TeX_Live) and integrating it with vim with the help of [this article](https://ejmastnak.com/tutorials/vim-latex/intro/) by ejmastnak. 

However, one can recompile my tex files through any online LaTeX editor such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project), [Arachnoid](https://arachnoid.com/latex/), etc.

# Sources 

I'll be learning the basics of LaTeX through [LearnLaTeX.org](https://www.learnlatex.org/en/)'s wonderful guide on LaTeX

# Propsed Goal

The goal of this project is to enable myself to learn LaTeX and finally create Case Study documents on some topics of the subjects I am currently taking in this semester.
