# learning-LaTeX
This repository is dedicated to document my journey on learning LaTeX, the typesetting tool used usually used in STEM.

I will be learning the following: 
- Installing LaTeX and plugging it with vim or nvim,
- Learning the standard document structure,
- Packages and implementing them,
- Text formatting,
- Bibliography,
- Mathatical Expressions and Equations and such.

I'll be ending this journey by preparing the case studies on Instrumentation and Operating Systems in LaTeX.
